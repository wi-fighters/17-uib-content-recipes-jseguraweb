    <h1>Spanish ham croquettes</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup/100 mL chicken broth</li>
        <li>8 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>3/4 cup/107 grams flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups/350 mL milk</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon nutmeg</li>
        <li>Dash of ground pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 cup ham (very finely hand-minced, so it can be mixed thoroughly with the dough)</li>
        <li>2 eggs (lightly beaten with 2 teaspoons water)</li>
        <li>1 cup breadcrumbs (for coating)</li>
        <li>1​ bottle Spanish olive oil (for frying)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Heat the 8 tablespoons olive oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the flour and cook for 3 minutes,
            stirring
            constantly. Gradually add the milk and the chicken broth, stirring without stopping. This can take up to 30
            minutes.</li>
        <li>Next, add the nutmeg, salt, and pepper to taste. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until the sauce
            is thickened
            and smooth.
        </li>
        <li>Add the minced ham and continue to cook for about 2 to 3 minutes on low heat, continuing to stir. Remove
            from heat.
            Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.</li>
        <li>Allow to cool for 5 to 10 minutes and refrigerate at least 3 hours until mixture is cold. If you are
            preparing a day or
            so ahead, you can cover the mixture tightly and keep refrigerated until you are ready to fry the croquettes.
        </li>
        <li>Pour the breadcrumbs into a small, wide bowl.</li>
        <li>Beat the eggs with water in a small, wide bowl.</li>
        <li>Cover your hands in flour, then divide the mixture into 1-inch balls and set on a plate, so that they are
            not touching.</li>
        <li>Pour enough olive oil in a medium-to-large frying pan to cover 1/2-inch deep. Heat the olive oil for frying
            to about 180°C.</li>
        <li>Dip the croquettes in the beaten egg and coat with crumbs by rolling in the bowl.</li>
        <li>Place the croquettes in the hot oil and fry quickly, turning several times, until golden.</li>
        <li>Remove the croquettes with a slotted spoon and set on a paper towel to absorb the excess oil.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately. If croquettes will not be served immediately, place in a warm oven (100°C) for up to 30
            minutes.</li>
    </ol>
